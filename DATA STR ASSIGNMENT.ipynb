    "DATA TYPE AND STRUCTURE THEORY QUESTIONS :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What are data structures, and why are they important ? \n",
    "ANS: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. \n",
    "     They are important for its efficiency and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples. \n",
    "ANS: Mutable data types:\n",
    "     Definition: Mutable objects can be changed after creation.\n",
    "     Examples in Python: list, dict, set.\n",
    "     Immutable data types:\n",
    "     definition: Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "     Examples in Python: int, float, bool, str, tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.  What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python ? \n",
    "ANS: Main difference in lists and python are its mutability, syntex and performance. Lists are mutable, uses in sqaure bracket and slightly slower          than tuples. Tuples are immutable, used in parenthesis and faster than lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Describe how dictionaries store data ? \n",
    "ANS: A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value. It is unordered before Python 3.7, but as of Python         3.7+, dictionaries preserve insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: You might use a set instead of a list in Python for a few key reasons, especially when working with unique items or when performance matters.\n",
    "     A set automatically removes duplicates. If you don’t want repeated elements, a set is ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list ? \n",
    "ANS: A string in Python is a sequence of Unicode characters, enclosed in quotes. Each character in the string has an index (starting from 0).\n",
    "     Strings are immutable — once created, they cannot be changed.A list is a collection of items (elements), which can be of any type (numbers,            strings, other lists, etc.), and is enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python? \n",
    "ANS: Tuples in Python help ensure data integrity by being immutable — once created, their contents cannot be changed. This behavior is essential when       you want to protect data from accidental modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python? \n",
    "ANS: A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides very fast access to values based on their keys.Python dictionaries are       implemented using hash tables under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Can lists contain different data types in Python ? \n",
    "ANS: Yes. In Python, lists can contain different data types all at once. Python lists are heterogeneous, meaning the elements inside a single list          don’t have to be of the same type. You can mix integers, strings, floats, objects, even other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: Immutability allows Python to intern strings (reuse identical string objects) for efficiency. Since strings don’t change, Python can safely share      them in memory without copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n",
    "ANS: Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for specific tasks, mainly due to how they organize and access data. Use dictionaries when you        want fast, meaningful access to data by keys and need to organize data as key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list ? \n",
    "ANS: Scenario: Storing Fixed, Immutable Data \n",
    "     location_data = {\n",
    "    (40.7128, -74.0060): \"New York City\",\n",
    "    (34.0522, -118.2437): \"Los Angeles\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ? \n",
    "ANS: In Python, sets automatically remove duplicate values — they only store unique elements. When you add an element to a set, Python checks if that       element is already present. If it is, the set ignores the duplicate and keeps only one copy. This behavior happens automatically without extra         effort from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries ?\n",
    "ANS:  The in keyword in Python is used to check membership, but it behaves differently and has different performance characteristics depending on            whether you use it with a list or a dictionary. Checks if a value exists anywhere in the list. It scans the list from start to end until it            finds a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not ? \n",
    "ANS. No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are immutable. You cannot directly modify tuple elements because tuples         are immutable. However, if a tuple holds mutable objects, those inner objects can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case ? \n",
    "ANS: A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where one or more values are themselves dictionaries. This allows you to create multi-level,             hierarchical data structures. Example Use Case: Storing Information About Employees: \n",
    "     employees = { \"emp1\": \"name\": \"Alice\" \"age\": 30, \"department\": \"HR\"  }, \"emp2\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"department\": \"Engineering }\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary ?\n",
    "ANS: Accessing elements in a Python dictionary generally has average-case time complexity of O(1) — constant time.\n",
    "     Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables. When you access a value by its key, Python:Computes the hash of the key (a fast              operation). Uses the hash to find the index (bucket) where the key-value pair is stored. Retrieves the value directly from that index. Since this      process doesn’t depend on the size of the dictionary, it’s constant time on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries ? \n",
    "ANS: Situations and Reasons :         \n",
    "     Ordered Data :\t    Lists maintain the order of elements, which is important if order matters (e.g., processing items sequentially).\n",
    "     Simple Collections of Items : \tWhen you just need to store a sequence of values without key-value pairs.\n",
    "     Index-Based Access : Lists allow easy access by position (index), which is faster and more intuitive for numeric indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval ? \n",
    "ANS: Dictionaries in Python are hash-based collections, designed for fast key-based access, not positional order. Originally (in Python versions < 3.7), dictionaries were considered unordered because:\n",
    "            The insertion order of keys was not preserved.\n",
    "            The internal order depended on the hash values of keys and could change between executions or when keys were added or removed.\n",
    "            This meant you couldn’t reliably predict the order in which items would appear when iterating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
    "ANS: Both lists and dictionaries are used to store collections of data in Python, but how you retrieve data from them is fundamentally different.\n",
    "    Feature     \tList\t             Dictionary\n",
    "Access type     \tBy index\t         By key\n",
    "Key/index type     \tInteger only\t     Any hashable object (e.g. string)\n",
